German version via AI (make yml and add placeholders)

- [x] Captions and translate
- [x] Lang switch
- [x] problem with clicking switch in goals section
  - works when html in yml replaces by a string
  - wrong rendering by chrome when html (makes no sense)
  - any bad chars?
- [x] also provide data in js version
  - [x] problem: experience and edu lists
  - [x] list captions for lang see #captions
- [x] captions read more

- [x] Simplify lang
  - keys must be like captions, value is data (prefer)
    - in advanced UI we could use some dropdown for langs
  - or all is data (maybe better cause user doesn't know about captions)
- [x] There is an problem with idx in list tranlation
  - use idx in html
