  - keys must be like captions, value is data (prefer)
    - in advanced UI we could use some dropdown for langs
  - or all is data (maybe better cause user doesn't know about captions)
- [ ] There is an problem with idx in list tranlation
  - use idx in html
- [ ] Shorten the mail
- [ ] new QR code
- [ ] move commonly used code from designs
- [ ] Make sidebar fully black h 100 in print layout
