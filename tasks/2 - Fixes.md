- [x] new QR code

- [ ] maybe add some AI generated toast that tells the user to set print paddings to 0
- [ ] move commonly used code from designs
- [ ] Make sidebar fully black h 100 in print layout, current solution:
  ```
  .sidebar {
    min-height: calc(59.4cm - 2rem);  /* current solution: page 2 * A4 high - padding */
  }
  ```

  ```
  How can I make sure that in the print layout, when a webpage while printed needs 2 A4 sizes pages, a left black sidebar fills all pages until the bottom.
  ```
